{"name":"[Official] Battle of the Black Sun", "desc":"Travel to a different world and become a hero!\n\r\nThere are many secret realms within this new world, each with their own unique journey. You can explore these realms with your friends, or you may choose to design your own.\r\n\nThese realms are filled with new dangers and opportunities. The only one here to accompany you is a robotic AI. You thought this would be a fulfilling and interesting journey, until you hear a familiar voice ring out in your mind...\n\r\n\nOfficial notes:\n\nOnline multiplayer mode is another direction we explore when developing the main game, and itâ€™s more like a experimental gameplay. \r\n\r\nWe provide players with the possibility of co-op in the desert, and provide samples and production tools to mod creators. We hope that even more players will begin designing their own worlds!" }
